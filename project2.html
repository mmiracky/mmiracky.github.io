            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>This project uses mapbox and ARkit. The goal is to walk around the real world and visit wayspots to unlock trees. You can plant these trees and they will generate money over time. You must also defend your trees from squirrels by throwing acorns at them.</p>
